# Task Tracker Application

This is a task management web application built with React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, filtering, searching and marking them as completed.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux** – A state management library for React applications.
- **Redux Toolkit** – To simplify Redux usage and boilerplate code.
- **React-Redux** – To integrate Redux with React.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks with a title, description, and status (Pending, Completed). Tasks are saved with the current date and time, allowing you to track when they were created.
- Edit Tasks: Quickly update task details, including the title, description, and status. Whether you need to correct a typo or mark a task as completed, the app allows for smooth task updates.
- Delete Tasks: Remove any completed or unnecessary tasks with a simple click. Deleting tasks helps you keep your list organized and relevant.
- Search Functionality: Effortlessly search through tasks by title, description, or status. The search bar provides real-time results, allowing you to find specific tasks quickly.
- Filter Tasks by Status: Use the filter dropdown to view tasks based on their current status.
- Interactive Modal Dialogs: Task editing and creation are done within a sleek modal dialog window, providing a focused and distraction-free experience for managing tasks.
- Persistent Data: Task data is stored in the local state, ensuring your tasks are retained as long as the app is open. (Can be extended to local storage or a database for long-term persistence).
